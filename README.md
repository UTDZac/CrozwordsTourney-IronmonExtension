## Options
| Option | Description |
| :----: | :---------: |
| Auto count points as you play | If enabled, the extension will automatically tally points as you complete milestones. Uncheck this if you prefer to count your points manually. |
| Must exit dungeons for points | If enabled, the extension won't award points for full clearing ("FC") a dungeon until you defeat all trainers **and** leave the dungeon alive. |
| Only count runs out of the lab | If enabled, the extension prevents the Tracker's attempt counter from increasing for seeds that don't make it out of the lab alive (1st Rival). |
